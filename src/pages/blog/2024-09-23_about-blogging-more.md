At the end of last week, I realized that I’m not blogging enough. Even before, I didn’t write in my blog (whichever one I was using at the time) that often, but I used to keep a physical journal. That’s no longer the case.

## Neglected journaling

I used to write in my journal often in the mornings, sometimes in the evenings, and it was always a nice and relaxing ritual for me, offering a chance for reflection.

I had already suspected that this activity would fall by the wayside once I started my retraining program. That’s why I had planned to use my blog for that purpose (even though it’s not quite the same).

But now I realize that I miss writing about whatever comes to mind because I usually only blog on the weekends. Then I started thinking about why that is.

Simply put, because I haven’t made writing easy enough for myself. In the mornings, I don’t have time to sit down and write. In the evenings, I technically have time, but it's so limited that I really have to think twice about how to use it. Most of the time, I’m tired and prefer to spend those few hours relaxing with my wife, whom I barely see all day.

## A new writing approach

I’ve been trying to use my phone less, managing to cut down to about an hour of phone time per day. But lately, I’ve been using it more, about an hour more each day since I started commuting by tram. That’s when the idea came to me that this time would be perfect for writing.

However, I’m not on any blogging platform or the like; I write my blog posts in Markdown, usually on my Laptop at home.

Sure, I could theoretically write my entries in the Notes app, but I wanted something “better.” That’s when I found and downloaded this app called Notion. The plan is to use this app solely for my website so that everything related to it — like ideas for posts, things I want to incorporate, and so on — is all in one place. That way, I stay organized and can remember my ideas later on. Plus, I can access it across platforms, which gives me the flexibility I need.

So far, everything worked out well today. I finished this post while on the go and can imagine that this setup could work long-term. I’m satisfied.
