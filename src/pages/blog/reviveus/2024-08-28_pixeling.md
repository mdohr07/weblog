A post about something else today, just quick. 

So, since I started the IT training I barely have time for other things. Kinda saw that coming. But I am still frustrated, not only because of that. But I have so much trouble with my skin recently. I developed this thing over the years, where I get skin rashes when I feel hot. Like, I don't really get to sweat and instead I get the rash and it's horrible, became worse and worse. This year is definitely the worst. So much so that right now I don't dare to cycle because it's so unpleasant. Crazy making, really, once it started. And the only thing that helps is cooling down which takes a while. Doctors appointment is all the way in October so I gotta just deal with it meanwhile. 

## Gaming (the retro kind)
I decided that, while I don't cycle to IT school I'm gonna play games on the tram. To be honest, I need something soothing to do and feel lazy about cycling to class anyway. I do miss road cycling though. Hopefully my fitness level is not gonna go down too much until the temperatures are decent enough for a little tour on my road bike. Well, currently I am playing Pok√©mon Red. I didn't used to play Pok√©mon, but my wife is into it. And since we played Shield and Sword together, I actually liked it and now decided to pick up an oldie. Sometimes I play Metroid in between, which I always wanted to give a try. My genre after all! üëΩ Both games are gonna take me a while. I know they are not that long, but I only play a little bit each day.

## Pixel Art 
Another thing that I don't have much time for anymore is drawing. To get a little bit of creative fun back into my life I decided to pick up pixel art again and do more of it this time. Since I don't do any other art right now. I'm trying to do at least one per day so I chose a random art challenge. Whenever I have some waiting time or something during class or in the break (because in most of my breaks I am socialising, tidying up my desk, making coffee etc.) I do a pixel drawing. 
I decided to do 32 x 32 Pixels so that I can put in a far amout of detail but I don't overburden myself, because it has to be something that can be done in a relatively short amout of time. And even though I really like restricting myself with only 4 colors I chose 16 this time for the extra bit of freedom. I think it's a good amount for the size too. I started uploading to <a href="https://lospec.com/mdohr07" target="_blank">Lospec</a>, because I grab my palettes from there and I love that feature! Uploads have to be approved though, so it takes a while for the art to be up. So, here's what I did so far:
