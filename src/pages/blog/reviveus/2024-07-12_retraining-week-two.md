After the second week of retraining, I feel good, but also like I need some distance and a break. I spent the last weekend studying and then, of course, the retraining continued straight away. There was one day when all the calculating really got me down and I couldn't see the forest for the trees. Yesterday we were allowed to go home early, but as there was a test today, I studied a bit more to be better prepared. As a result, I'm now tired and especially don't want to see numbers anymore!

I think I've got the conversion of units down now, it's the text problems that are giving me a hard time and are currently my biggest hurdle.

## Git good
Fortunately, we didn't just do math, but as mentioned in the last blog post, we also started using Git. I've already dabbled with Git a bit in the not too distant past when I started using Github. However, I only scratched the surface a little, because I can also synchronize well using VSCode's built-in feature. But I've been interested in Git ever since and somehow I like Terminals. Maybe because it feels retro? Or because it's somehow magical? Because it's like talking to a computer? It could also be a combination of these things. 
Admittedly, I didn't quite dare to experiment with it and I'm glad that I've now got to know the subject better and will be able to delve even deeper into it in the future.

Working with the console was not entirely foreign to me, but with guidance and the possibility of help, I feel more comfortable feeling my way around. So first we fiddled around with Command Prompt and then Git Bash and got to know a few basics. Afterwards, we had a quick look at the Git GUI, but just to see it for ourselves. Fortunately, because I liked the terminal much better üòã
At some point, we were all supposed to create a Gitlab account where we committed, pushed and pulled nonsense in a shared repository. I took the opportunity to share pictures of aliens with my seatmates. But I'm glad to have been able to help them too, just like they helped me with my math problems. Git is definitely more my thing and I really enjoyed it.

Yesterday - inspired by one of my seatmates - I bought a small manual on Git (link) and have already started reading it. Since it's so handy and compact, it's perfect for boring streetcar rides (because I don't take the bike in the rain due to not having rain gear) and as bedtime reading.
Gitlab was new to me and also Sourcetree, which we should all download and have a look at. I still like the terminal better, but the visual representation of the history with all the branches including commit messages is something nice!

## About learning
So to summarize, this week I learned a bit about using Git via Git Bash, used Gitlab and Sourcetree for the first time, and liked it. For the test today, as I said, I did a little more studying - this included math problems, a review of computer connections (drawing these helps my memory the most), and a little Git. I scored 87% on the test, if it hadn't been for the math problem (or if I had managed to solve that one), I probably would have been close to perfect. I'm not surprised that this was my biggest problem. Nevertheless, I count the test result as a success, but unfortunately I still have to keep practicing math.

What helps me to learn is to write down as much as possible as clearly as possible and always write the units after the numbers. It always took me a particularly long time to do the exercises in class because I wrote everything down precisely and as neatly as possible - in other words, I made sure that everything was organized and correctly arranged. That was annoying, especially when I came into the break later than others, but I'm afraid I have to have it that way.

## Social aspects and prospects
We have team and communication training coming up next week. I wouldn't know how to prepare for it and what exactly to expect. I assume it will be exhausting - especially for introverts like me. But the time will probably pass particularly quickly. And: then there will definitely be no math üòÅ <sub>...right?? </sub>

For me, it's a big leap from freelancing and working alone most of my time to now: working full time in a group, constantly surrounded by people and working in a team. In one way, it's a challenge, but on the other hand, I also like not being on my own anymore in terms of work and learning. 

I can't say that I'm really looking forward to the team and communication training, but I'm excited and ready to be surprised. I also hope that it will bring improvements, because I have noticed a few problems in the group and the group dynamics. Will it also teach me to address problems myself? I prefer to avoid doing that and I'm aware of it. I'll just let this week come to me and want to enjoy some free time until then. It's supposed to rain, so I'm almost afraid I won't be able to ride my road bike. But hope dies last. But if I stay inside, I'd love to keep playing Encased! üòä

Until next time! üëã
