The first week of retraining is behind me and I would like to reflect on it a little in this post. I'd love to write a review like this every week, but unfortunately I might not have the time. 

On the first day, I wanted to arrive early so that I could secure a window seat. Things didn't go as planned: my plans to ride my bike were thwarted. When I left the house, it was raining more than expected and I spontaneously decided to leave the bike and jump on the next tram. Unfortunately, there were some detour and cancellations due to track works, so I had no alternative and had to rely on a certain tram line that only runs every twenty minutes. So I made it to the company building just in time and most of the seats were taken. But I was still lucky because I'm in very good company where I'm sitting now üòÅ

I'm actually feeling pretty good after this week, so far I'm enjoying the retraining. Even though we are given so many math problems. 
Overall, the atmosphere is relaxed and I feel like I'm in good hands. But I also know that we are starting slowly and that the pace and level of difficulty will gradually increase - we were informed of this from the start. I think this is definitely a good concept.

## Topics from week one
It was very much about units and their conversion. We learned how to convert from decimal to binary, octal and hexadecimal and vice versa. Another important topic was calculating memory space. Both of these will continue into next week and I wouldn't be surprised if they come up again at a later date, as they are relevant to the exam.
I've never been able to make friends with math, but I already knew that I wouldn't be able to avoid it for my retraining as an IT specialist.

As difficult as some of these tasks are for me, I'm lucky that we have a nice and patient teacher who would explain things to me twice and three times, and my classmates are also very helpful and understanding, so I can always turn to them with questions. I notice that I have already improved and gained in self-confidence. The tasks that I found difficult at first are now easier for me. 

Apart from the fact that these are new topics, I also have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to math, which is why I spent the weekend working on it. Yesterday I studied almost the whole day, today until lunchtime. I would have preferred to do something else, but I want to catch up so that it's easier for me next week and, above all, I don't want to fail the final exam part 1 - even if there's still time until then - and I want to get as good grades as possible. 

We also learned a bit about the history of computers and looked at hardware and connections. For me, these topics are a respite from all the mathy tasks and seeing an old computer and its contents for learning purposes brought back memories. For example, I remember the PS/2 ports for the mouse and keyboard from back in the day and I'm in the minority as most of the class are younger than me.

## What I took away from the week
I can't panic when I see a math problem in front of me and it seems overwhelming at first. It will be the same with problems that we will have to solve through code, or with code itself. Sometimes I need to be reminded to break the problem down into its component parts and take it step by step. 
Since I'm already seeing progress in my approach and also in my attitude towards unloved math problems, I find it quite motivating. It now feels more like I can do what I set out to do here and it didn't necessarily feel like that two weeks ago. 

I also got myself a new journal because my old one was full (way too quickly, by the way, the Leuchtturm journal was too thin for the price). It's actually a sketchbook, but I use it to take notes and draw or doodle something, as long as I can still follow the lesson (I can't do that with math...). I think it was a very good idea myself, because it gives me an overview of what has happened in the retraining and I can document my progress and write guidelines for myself. Then I can refer back to this information again and again.

### Outlook
In the week starting tomorrow, I want to be better prepared for the tasks that I found difficult last week and do better this time. It would be great if I could solve something without any help that I failed at last week. Next week we will also be looking at version control with Git, which I am really looking forward to. I've already done a bit of work on the subject and was planning to learn it properly, but that hasn't happened yet. That's why I'm looking forward to it.
