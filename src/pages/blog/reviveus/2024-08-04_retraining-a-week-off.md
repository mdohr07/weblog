So I had this week off. Conveniently, it was also my birthday and I actually used the time to relax (for the most part). I took the first weekend in particular very slowly and was - by my definition - lazy 😁

## Retro Gaming
Lately I've been in the mood for games and preferably with a retro feel. The first thing I did was to dig out my old Nintendo 2DS XL, charge it up, update the system and download my games again. And by games, I mean one single game. Which really annoyed me back when I bought the device. Okay, it still annoys me: I had bought a few games from the online store, not many, but for example "Legend Of Dark Witch" and "Super Mario". However, I had bought these on the previous console (I can't remember what I had before that... DSi?) and although I still use the same Nintendo account, I could no longer download these titles. The only title I can download again is the Mario Kart that came with the console. I think Nintendo wants me to take out an online membership on the Switch, which means I'm <i>allowed</i> to use Virtual Console and then <i>allowed</i> to play Super Mario again. I think that's pretty bad. After all, I've already bought Super Mario once, for example, and if I want to play it again now, I have to pay for a monthly membership on top of having bought it before? I would have preferred to just buy it once and then keep it, that's fine. But that's not how it works anymore. 

I made do with Mario Kart 7 for the time being. That was also quite fun again. I must have forgotten that Toad sounds like a maniac. One more thing: since I've already decided to bring the 2DS XL back to life, I've now also decorated it with stickers. Kind of surprising that I hadn't done that before. But now it looks like mine 😊🌈✨

I also finally created a Mii on the Nintendo Switch and because it was so nice, I also made the same Mii on the 2DS, just so I could see how stupid the Mii looks when kart racing 🤭

My birthday was on Monday and we had a little family get-together, even though unfortunately not everyone could be there. We had coffee and cake. Except that I ate a waffle with ice cream and lots of stuff with it and my wife ate bruscetta because sweets aren't her thing.

Speaking of sweet: I was tempted to play something else for a change from Mario Kart: Hamtaro Rainbow Rescue! It's totally cute and makes me laugh, but I might not play it all the way through. I don't find it <i>that</i> captivating after all 😅

## Cycling
Yes, of course I was out on my road bike too! Not as much as it could have been because we had another date in the beer garden after the birthday get-together and another date on Friday where a friend invited us for dinner and... just other stuff, you know how it is. I was happy to see everyone again and to be able to spend time together! 

I went road biking three times during the week off. I wasn't particularly adventurous, so I didn't try out any new routes and kept them rather short at 15 to 23 kilometers each. One reason for this was that it got pretty hot outside early on and that doesn't suit me very well. That's why I tried to be back home by lunchtime and rode at a "leisurely" pace. Except for today. It was pleasant outside today, with slightly cooler temperatures and (unfortunately?) a bit of wind, which I sometimes had to pedal against. But when the wind is at your back, of course I like it 😏

## Prospects
IT starts again tomorrow. I've enjoyed the time off, but I'm also looking forward to the new month of training. We have a different lecturer from tomorrow and the topic we are starting with is structured programming. Let's see!
